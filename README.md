•	The analysis was done by using Python , primarily using Pandas for data Manipulation, Matplotlib for visualizations

4. Data Analysis Techniques:-
•	Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): EDA was conducted to understand various aspects of customer behavior on the e-commerce platform, such as age distribution, device usage, and purchasing patterns. This analysis provided a foundational understanding of how different user segments interact with the website.

This could imply that while men may visit more often, women tend to be more thorough in exploring products, which may impact their purchasing decisions.
• Device Usage Analysis: The analysis found that the average time spent on mobile devices was higher compared to desktop and tablet usage. This highlights the importance of mobile optimization for user experience, as a significant portion of users prefer to browse and shop using their smartphones.
